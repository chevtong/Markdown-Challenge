## A funny story 
*When I visited Nepal some years ago, I took a long-haul local bus to move between two cities. More and more passengers were entered during the trip. Literally there were no more space inside the bus, and the driver just asked us to move up on the roof! I climbed up on the roof (literally roof, without any seat) and sit with all the luggages, balancing myself not to fall down to the rough Himalays moutain road for the next 6 hours.*  

### *The most dangerous roadtrip in my life*
